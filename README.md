# Frequency channel alocation
In a GSM network every antenna can have multiple frequency channels, which can range from 1 to 6. 
While assigning frequency channels to the antennas in the network, there are multiple factors that need to be considered in order to have an optimised solution.
Major problem in this project is being addressed is Interference. Which can be occurred by following parameters:
1) Distance between transmitters 
2) Geographical position
3) Direction in which signals are transmitted (onidirectional in our case)
4) Weather conditions 
5) Assigned frequencies 
6) Co-channel interference 
7) Adjacent-channel interference
Considering all parameters above excluding weather conditions, Simulator assigns the frequencies to the antennas provided as inputs to the simulator.
